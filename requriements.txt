# GPU-Accelerated Libraries (Install via conda for compatibility)
# Ensure that your system has a compatible NVIDIA GPU and CUDA drivers installed.
# It's recommended to create a new conda environment and install RAPIDS libraries as per their official guidelines.
# For example:
# conda create -n rapids-22.12 -c rapidsai -c nvidia -c conda-forge \
#     cudf=22.12 cuml=22.12 python=3.8 cudatoolkit=11.0
# More details: https://rapids.ai/start.html

# The following are placeholders to indicate the need for these libraries.
# Do NOT install them via pip.
# cudf
# cuml
# cupy
